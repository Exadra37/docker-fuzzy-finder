# WHY EXISTS?

Because when I was in the Elixir forum, the user @mkunikow linked it on [this reply](https://elixirforum.com/t/when-would-you-not-use-elixir/12850/31?u=exadra37).

So I decided to give it a try and got in love for the ability to quickly search,
filter and preview the files with syntax highlight :).
